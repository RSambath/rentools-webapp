<=========================== RenTools Website ===========================>
# This is a read me about how to get the website up and running on your computer. 

The code for the website can be found at https://github.com/RSambath/rentools-webapp

#Follow the steps below to download front end code
--------------------------------------------

1. Go to https://github.com/RSambath/rentools-webapp
2. Click the Green <> Code button towards in the middle of the screen.
3. Click download zip
This will download the code into a zip file which we will extract later. 
4. Extract the zip file into a folder. 
5. You should see a folder named rentools-webapp
   - From within this folder is where you need to run the front-end code from.

#Follow the steps below to run the front end code
--------------------------------------------
1. Run the code using a Code Editor (IDE) For our team we used Microsoft Visual Studio 	
   - Code which can be downloaded here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the dependencies needed to run the code. 
   - The code has dependencies such as Node.js (NPM), React.js, Tailwindcss, React-Router-Dom, React-Datepicker, React-Image-Gallery.
   - Make sure all of these dependencies are installed otherwise the code will not run.
3. Open the editor terminal. In the case of Visual Studio Code that can be done using the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+`(tilde) or from the tab at the top.
4. If node is already installed, then type in "npm start"
5. This should automatically open your default web browser to display the frontend. 
   - However, you might notice that the images are not there and the login page do not     work. The backend code also need to run at the same time in order for the full functionality of the code to work.

#Follow the steps below to download the back end code
-------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://github.com/ankozan/rentit
2. Repeat the steps within the download code section to retrieve the back end code

#Follow the steps below to run the back end code
-------------------------------------------
1. Run the code using another instance of code editor (IDE)
2. The backend code needs Java to work. Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed which can be found here
   - https://www.java.com/en/
3. Some extensions are needed if you are using Visual Studio Code to run. 
   - The extensions we used are: Extension Pack for Java and Spring Initializr Java Support.
4. If the above steps are done correctly. Then you can build the backend by either clicking the play button at the top or by pressing F5.
With both frontend and backend running. The website should now display correctly.
